A revamp of Certification projects from free Code Camp's Responsive Web Design Certification

Around mid 2022 after graduating, I realised I was interested in coding. Having previosuly studied HTML and CSS in hgih school, I knew something of coding and how to begin. And thus began this journey. 

free Code Camp is the first place I found that actively taught me how to write code. I could see the execution immediately and I promised myself I would complete the Responsive Web Design Certification. Which I did. But I always seemed to be a little burnt out by the time I got to the certification projects. As a result, I put in minimal effort for the same, despite having understood the concepts fCC tried to teach.

Here, I attempt to remedy that by redoing the certification projects and learning even more CSS along the way. Thanks for sticking with me so far. I hope to grow a lot more but as of right now, this is a very beginner, intro-level code which, quite frankly, I am proud of.
